# Annex Protocol Buffers

Annex uses [Connect](https://connectrpc.com/) to build gRPC APIs that are browser friendly.

## Generating

Simply run `make gen` to generate code for the protobuf schemas in `proto/`.

## Disclaimer

Annex is currently considered as a proof of concept and is not intended for serious use at this stage. Corners have
purposefully been cut to allow for rapid development, which means major/breaking changes are to be expected.
